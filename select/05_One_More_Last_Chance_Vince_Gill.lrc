[00:12.81] She was standing at the front door
[00:14.95] When I came home last night
[00:17.89] Good Book in her left hand
[00:20.33] And a rolling pin in her right
[00:23.16] She said you've come home for the last time
[00:25.85] With the whiskey on your breath
[00:28.69] If you don't listen to my preaching, boy
[00:31.12] I'm gonna have to beat you half to death
[00:51.12] 
[00:34.96] Give me just a one more last chance
[00:38.28] Before you say we're through
[00:40.85] I know I drive you crazy baby
[00:43.46] It's the best that I can do
[00:46.10] We're just good ol' boys, a-makin' noise
[00:48.87] I ain't runnin' around on you
[00:51.33] Give me just a one more last chance
[00:54.50] Before you say we're through
[01:08.50] 
[01:01.57] First she hid my glasses
[01:03.65] Because she knows that I can't see
[01:06.62] She said you ain't going nowhere boy
[01:09.20] Til you spend a little time with me
[01:11.86] Then the boys called from the honky tonk
[01:14.61] Said there's a party going on down here
[01:17.37] Well she might have took my car keys
[01:20.02] But she forgot about my old John Deere
[01:39.02] 
[01:23.86] Gimme just a one more last chance
[01:27.38] Before you say we're through
[01:30.09] I know I drive you crazy baby
[01:32.67] It's the best that I can do
[01:35.10] We're just good ol' boys, making noise
[01:37.83] I ain't runnin' round on you
[01:40.31] Gimme just a one more last chance
[01:43.61] Before you say we're through
[01:57.61] 
[02:10.19] Gimme just one more last chance
[02:13.60] Before you say we're through
[02:16.25] I know I drive you crazy, baby
[02:18.85] It's the best that I can do
[02:21.25] We're just good ol' boys, making noise
[02:24.15] I ain't runnin' around on you
[02:38.65] 
[02:26.58] Gimme just a one more last chance
[02:29.82] Before you say we're through
[02:31.92] Give me just one more last chance
[02:35.14] Before you say we're through
